            <!-- Obviously this is the hardest part, writing about myself. saved for last -->
            <p>
                I am an accomplished musician and database developer seeking employment as a full-stack web developer. I love composing memorable user experiences built on robust and scalable foundations. I know in my heart that relaxed focus is not mutually exclusive to a high-pace work environment, and that balance is where I thrive. My passion for creative expression, working as part of an ensemble, and solving problems will make me an asset to any team.
