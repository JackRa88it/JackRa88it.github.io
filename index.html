            <!-- Obviously this is the hardest part, writing about myself. saved for last -->
            <p>
                I am an odd combination of things. I have walked far down the path of a performing musician, but I have also learned to design and develop databases that a company can rely on. I have won awards in international music competitions, created and maintained a fully-compliant ISO 9001.2008 Quality Management System, and developed multiple FileMaker Pro databases that controlled processes across departments. I am passionate about broadening my knowledge and perspective, honing my coding skills, and tackling big programming challenges by finding creative solutions.<br><br>I enrolled in a full-stack web development coding boot camp through UC Berkeley Extension to enhance my skills in HTML/CSS/Javascript, integrating outside APIs and libraries, and planning system architecture to be robust and scalable. I love working in fast-paced, high-pressure situations; they make me feel incredibly awake and deeply happy.<br><br>I love music, art, space exploration, laughing until my face hurts, and having emotionally impactful experiences with technology. I believe creative programming can enable us to reach new heights in knowledge and exploration, and to tell stories that help us understand a little more about who we are. Thank you for your time :)
